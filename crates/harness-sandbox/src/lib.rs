//! rustyharness execution confinement.
//!
//! SCAFFOLD (2026-09-23). The one rule settled before any backend exists:
//! **no containment, no execution.** When this platform cannot establish the
//! full confinement a policy asks for, [`require`] refuses — there is no
//! "run it anyway and record that it was unsandboxed" path. rustybenchmark
//! has exactly that fail-open path today (suite AQ-194); this crate must not
//! repeat it.
//!
//! Backends (macOS seatbelt, Linux landlock + seccomp + namespaces, Windows
//! Job Objects + AppContainer) are designed in the suite's cross-platform
//! sandbox work (lane d27) and the rustyharness design; none is built yet, so
//! [`available`] reports `Unavailable` on every platform and [`require`]
//! refuses everywhere. That is the correct scaffold behaviour.
