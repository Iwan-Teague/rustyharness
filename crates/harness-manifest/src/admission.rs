//! Trust tiers and admission as data (design §4.4), with the H1 phase gate.
//!
//! A [`Registry`] is the set of providers a session may draw capabilities
//! from. It is built in one step, [`Registry::admit`], over every
//! `(manifest, tier)` pair, and the checks run in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Shadowing (INV-8):** two entries with the same namespace are
//!    refused, whatever their tiers.
//! 2. **Tier coherence:** `builtin` tier ⇔ a compiled-in manifest.
//! 3. **Tier data rules (§4.4 table):** a `pinned` manifest may not declare
//!    `sensitivity > operational` or `blast_radius > host`, and may not be an
//!    in-process adapter (§4.5: in-process is `builtin` or `signed` only).
//! 4. **H1 phase gate:** what this build cannot honour is REFUSED, not
//!    accepted on trust. Signature verification and manifest-hash pinning
//!    need the ed25519 and SHA-256 crates and the admission CLI (H4);
//!    mcp-stdio and in-process transports need `harness-mcp` / `Conformed`
//!    (H2/H4); secret handles need the §5.5 secrets boundary (H2). So in H1
//!    only the `builtin` tier with a secret-free `builtin` transport admits.
//!
//! The data rules (1-3) run before the phase gate so they are exercised now
//! and cannot silently rot while the gate hides them.
