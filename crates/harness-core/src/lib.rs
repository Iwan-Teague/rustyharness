//! rustyharness core types. Pure: no I/O, no async, no model or tool calls.
//!
//! SCAFFOLD (2026-09-23). The types here encode invariants that are already
//! settled by reviewed suite designs; everything else waits for the
//! rustyharness design (docs/00-overview.md, research pipeline in docs/research/).
//!
//! The gate-layer outcome type lives in the sibling `gate-outcome` crate
//! (`GateOutcome { Passed(Witness), Failed, Indeterminate { why } }`); this
//! crate defines none and must never (the INV-28 grep gate refuses any
//! `enum …Outcome`/`enum …Verdict` under `crates/harness-*`). The run-loop
//! types here (`StopCause`, `Meter`, `LoopDetector`) are deliberately NOT
//! verdicts: they describe why a run loop ended, not whether a claim held.
//!
//! H1a adds the §1.3 run-loop slice: [`Meter`] (six self-measured budget
//! dimensions replacing the steps-only `Budget`) and [`LoopDetector`]
//! (design §2.6). Both are pure: time and token usage are passed IN.

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// The panic-set lints ratchet production code; unit tests may assert loosely.

///   every other step is noticed once and then stopped.
/// - "New" observation and tree digests mean never seen before in this run,
///   not merely different from the last one. Alternating between two
///   already-seen digests is not progress. The seen sets grow by at most one
///   entry per event, and the step budget bounds the events in a run.
