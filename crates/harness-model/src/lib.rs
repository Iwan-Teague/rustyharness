//! The model layer (design `docs/01-design-v0.1.md` §3, §2.2 steps 3-4,
//! §2.9, §5.5; H1 row of §9).
//!
//! - [`ModelBackend`]: one call, one [`Completion`] or a typed
//!   [`ModelError`]. Implementations: [`client::OpenAiCompatible`]
//!   (loopback HTTP), [`replay::ReplayBackend`] (§2.9), and
//!   [`scripted::ScriptedBackend`] (tests).
//! - [`Message`] carries its trust mark across the loop boundary
//!   (scaffold review F4): only harness templates and the task are trusted;
//!   model replies and observations are [`Untrusted`]. [`wire::render_request`]
//!   is the one place they are read for the wire.
//! - [`protocol`]: both action protocols, parsed strictly; only the model's
//!   own reply is ever parsed (INV-29), free text outside the action stays
//!   untrusted reasoning, and a format error is charged to the meter.
//! - [`profile`]: per-model profiles (§3.4) and the `profile check` scoring.
//!
//! **Pure and I/O parts.** The pure half (`endpoint`, `wire`, `protocol`,
//! `profile`, `context` and the data types) is the separate pure crate
//! `harness-model-core`, re-exported here (H1e-1 review NF-A); `http` and
//! `client` own the sockets; `replay` and `smoke` are generic over a
//! backend.
//!
//! **Blocking, not tokio (for now).** Design §3.2 sketches the client over
//! tokio because rmcp (H4) needs a runtime. For loopback-only H1 a blocking
//! client over `std::net` needs no dependency at all, and the trait is
//! synchronous like `ToolProvider` (H1c); the async decision is H1e's, with
//! the loop.
