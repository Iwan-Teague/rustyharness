//! The tool-provider seam (design §4.5, §2.2 steps 7-8). Signature only:
//! built-in tools, the MCP adapter and the loop that drives them are later
//! slices (H1e, H4).
//!
//! `ToolProvider::invoke` accepts exactly one argument type for the call,
//! `Journaled<Authorized<Call>>`:
//! - `Authorized<Call>` is minted only by `harness_policy::Session::authorize`,
//!   and only for an `Allow` decision;
//! - `Journaled<_>` is minted only by
//!   `harness_journal::JournalWriter::append_intent`, after the intent record
//!   was written and fsynced.
//!
//! So no provider can be driven by an unvalidated call, or by one whose
//! intent is not durably journaled: those are not merely forbidden, they do
//! not typecheck (F-01, INV-33).
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! // An authorised but unjournaled call is the wrong type.
//! fn drive<P: harness_tools::ToolProvider>(
//!     p: &mut P,
//!     call: harness_policy::Authorized<harness_policy::Call>,
//!     ctx: &harness_tools::InvokeCtx,
//! ) {
//!     let _ = p.invoke(call, ctx);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! // A journaled but unauthorised call is the wrong type too.
//! fn drive<P: harness_tools::ToolProvider>(
//!     p: &mut P,
//!     call: harness_journal::Journaled<harness_policy::Call>,
//!     ctx: &harness_tools::InvokeCtx,
//! ) {
//!     let _ = p.invoke(call, ctx);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Sync for now.** Design §4.5 sketches `async fn invoke`. The async
//! runtime arrives with the I/O slices (H1d/H1e, rmcp in H4), and an `async
//! fn` in a public trait needs a decision on `Send` bounds; that decision is
//! left to H1e. The argument type, which is what F-01 is about, is fixed
//! here.
