# Purity + INV-28 gates (rustyharness design docs/01-design-v0.1.md §1.2).
#
# Five pure crates: gate-outcome, harness-core, harness-manifest,
# harness-policy and harness-model-core. Purity means no I/O, no async, no clock reads, no global
# state — checked two ways:
#
#   1. dependency shape: `cargo tree --target all -e normal,build` of each
#      pure crate (and of harness-model) must stay
#      inside its reviewed allowlist (gate-outcome has ZERO default deps);
#   2. content: the pure crates' Rust files must not so much as NAME an I/O,
#      process, environment, thread, console, or clock facility.
#
# INV-28: exactly one outcome type in the suite. No `enum …Outcome` /
# `enum …Verdict` may appear in any Rust file under crates/harness-* — the
# verdict lives in gate-outcome (gate-outcome itself is exempt: it IS the
# outcome crate).
#
# INV-23 (§2f): every spawn in the harness is one of the fixed queries in
# crates/harness-sandbox/src/capture.rs, so no payload reaches an argv.
#
# Fail closed: every tool call is checked. A tool that errors, or a check
# that read nothing, fails the gate; it never prints OK.
# scripts/ci/purity-selftest.sh plants violations and proves each refusal.

# --- 2e. the shipped binary uses the real locality probe (INV-35) ----------

# build of it may choose another (H1e-2b review F-2). Checked by content,
# not by name (H1e-2b confirming review NF-2: a local `struct` with the
# production name passed a name-only check): main.rs must import the probe
# from its real path, name it exactly twice (that import and the one
# `probe:` field), and define or alias nothing (no struct, enum, trait,
# impl, mod, type, const, static, macro or `as` rename) that could shadow
# it. (Tests pass their own probe to the CLI library in process; the
# binary has no switch.)

# --- 2f. INV-23: one spawn module, three fixed programs ---------------------
# Prompts, task text and approval payloads never appear on any argv (design
# §10 INV-23, R3 H-08). Structural, not by call shape (H1f-4 review F-1:
# turbofish, UFCS, aliases, raw identifiers and macros all defeat a pattern
# for `Command::new(`): every spawn in the harness goes through the closed
# `Query` enum in crates/harness-sandbox/src/capture.rs, which fixes each
# program and argv. So:
#   - no symlink under crates/, and no `#[path]` or `include!` in any source
#     under crates/*/src (they could bring in code this scan never reads);
#   - no source file with a NUL byte (a NUL makes grep read a file as binary);
#   - the words `Command`, `CommandExt` and `raw_arg` appear in code (comments
#     and literal contents stripped) in no source under crates/*/src except
#     capture.rs and its `#[cfg(test)]` tests (capture/tests.rs); any spelling
#     of a spawn has to write one of them;
#   - capture.rs declares its tests `#[cfg(test)]`, names `Command` (so the
#     scan read it), and every absolute-path literal in it is one of the
#     programs §4.5 lists: /sbin/mount, /usr/sbin/sysctl, /usr/bin/vm_stat.
# Integration tests (crates/*/tests/) are separate test crates and may spawn
# freely. Fails closed on legitimate code too: prose inside code, a type or
# method named `Command` elsewhere, or another program in capture.rs are all
# refused, and need a review of this gate to allow.
